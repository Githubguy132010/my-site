## Who am I?

I am Thomas, a Linux enthousiast & hobby developer. I live in Gouda (Netherlands) and have some experience with Bash and YAML. I also use VSCode as my IDE and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for development. I mostly create hobby projects for my own needs and automate them with Github Actions. For example, I built an config file for an immutable Arch Linux system called BlendOS. You can check BlendOS out [here][blendOSWebsite].

You can check my config [here][repoLink]


## My Github profile

As you can see [here][githubProfileLink] my Github profile does not look too great, but this will improve over time. But as you can see, I have a bunch of projects I am working on. Some more than others, but this is for a reason: The projects that are the most valuable to me, I work on the most, while others get less love.
