The "Arch-Linux-without-the-beeps" project has recently seen a series of significant improvements aimed at streamlining the release process and enhancing documentation. These updates focus on automation and clarity, making it easier to track changes and build the custom ISO.

### Automated and Detailed Release Notes Generation

A major enhancement is the introduction of a new GitHub Actions workflow dedicated to generating automated and detailed release notes. This workflow triggers upon new releases and compiles a comprehensive list of changes, saving manual effort and ensuring consistency.

### Categorizing Release Notes from Commit Messages

The new workflow includes logic to analyze commit messages. By examining the structure and content of commits, the workflow categorizes the changes into meaningful sections such as new features, bug fixes, and maintenance updates. This provides a clear and organized overview of what's included in each release.

### Main Build Workflow Integration

The main build workflow for the Arch Linux ISO has been updated to leverage these detailed, automatically generated release notes. When a new ISO is built and released via the workflow, the detailed notes are now automatically included in the corresponding GitHub release description, providing users with immediate access to the changes.

### Documentation Updates

To reflect these changes and ensure users can easily understand and utilize the new process, the [`README.md`](README.md) file has been updated. The documentation now includes details on the automated release notes generation and its benefits. Additionally, a minor change to the ISO build command has been documented to keep the instructions up-to-date.

These recent improvements significantly enhance the release management and documentation of the "Arch-Linux-without-the-beeps" project, contributing to a more efficient and user-friendly experience.
