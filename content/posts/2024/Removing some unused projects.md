I would like to announce that I will be removing several inactive projects from my GitHub account. After reviewing my repositories, I've identified projects that are no longer being maintained or used.

Projects being removed:

* **Archcraft** ([GitHub](https://github.com/Githubguy132010/archcraft))  
  A fork intended to replicate Arch Linux modifications without audio signals. (Arch Linux without the beeps)
  * **Reason for removal:** Lack of development progress.

* **Vanilla-OS-image** ([GitHub](https://github.com/Githubguy132010/VanillaOS-image))  
  A repo for a custom VanillaOS image that I was working on.
  * **Reason for removal:** Lack of development progress & no longer needed/wanted.

* **My-system-helper-scripts** ([GitHub](https://github.com/Githubguy132010/My-system-helper-scripts))  
  A collection of scripts that I use to help manage [My-system](https://github.com/Githubguy132010/My-system).
  * **Reason for removal:** Lack of development progress & no longer needed/wanted.

* **Ubuntu-autoinstall** ([GitHub](https://github.com/Githubguy132010/Ubuntu-autoinstall))  
  A repo for a custom Ubuntu autoinstall script that I was working on.
  * **Reason for removal:** Lack of development progress & no longer needed/wanted.

* **My-system-testing** ([GitHub](https://github.com/Githubguy132010/My-system-testing))  
  A repo for testing/development for [My-system](https://github.com/Githubguy132010/My-system)
  * **Reason for removal:** Lack of development progress & no longer needed/wanted.

* **blend-inst** ([GitHub](https://github.com/Githubguy132010/blend-inst))  
  A repo for a custom BlendOS install config that I was working on.
  * **Reason for removal:** Lack of development progress & no longer needed/wanted.

I will be **removing** these repositories on GitHub, so they wont be accessible anymore. If you have any questions or concerns about this decision, please feel free to reach out to me.
