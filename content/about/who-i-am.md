## Hi, I'm Thomas 👋

A Linux enthusiast and hobby developer from the Netherlands with a passion for automation and open source. I specialize in:

- 🐧 Linux System Configuration
- 🔧 Shell Scripting (Bash)
- ⚙️ Infrastructure as Code (YAML)
- 🤖 GitHub Actions Automation
- 🖥️ WSL Development

Currently working on a [BlendOS](https://www.blendos.co) config, an immutable Arch Linux setup with a focus on developer productivity and my own needs.
