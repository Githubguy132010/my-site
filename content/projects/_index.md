### Arch Linux Configuration

I maintain a collection of Arch Linux configuration files and scripts for my personal system. These are designed to eliminate system beeps on the Arch Linux install media. These files are available on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Githubguy132010/Arch-Linux-without-the-beeps).

## Open Source Contributions
I regularly contribute to open source projects and create tools for my own workflow automation. Most of my work focuses on:
- Linux system configuration
- Shell scripting
- GitHub Actions workflows
