# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
- This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site using the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme (see `themes/PaperMod`).
- Content is organized in `content/` (posts, pages, etc.), with archetypes in `archetypes/` and static assets in `static/`.
- Custom CSS is in `assets/css/extended/custom.css` and `static/css/background.css`.
- The main site configuration is in `hugo.toml`.

## Key Workflows
- **Build the site:** Run `hugo` from the project root. Output is generated in `public/`.
- **Serve locally:** Run `hugo server -D` to preview drafts and changes at `http://localhost:1313`.
- **Add new content:** Use `hugo new <section>/<name>.md` (e.g., `hugo new posts/2025/new-post.md`).
- **Theme updates:** The PaperMod theme is a subdirectory in `themes/`. Customizations should go in `layouts/` or `assets/` to avoid modifying theme files directly.

## Project-Specific Conventions
- **Content organization:**
  - Posts are nested by year in `content/posts/<year>/`.
  - About, contact, and projects have their own subfolders under `content/`.
- **Custom layouts:**
  - Custom HTML layouts are in `layouts/` (e.g., `layouts/_default/home.html`).
  - Partial templates are in `layouts/partials/`.
- **Static assets:**
  - Images are in `static/images/`.
  - CSS overrides are in `assets/css/extended/` and `static/css/`.
- **Do not edit files in `public/` directly**â€”this folder is auto-generated by Hugo.

## Integration Points
- **Theme:** PaperMod is used as a Hugo theme. See its [README](themes/PaperMod/README.md) and [Wiki](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/wiki) for advanced configuration.
- **No Node.js or Webpack:** All asset processing is handled by Hugo's built-in pipeline.
- **SEO, social, and multilingual:** Managed via Hugo config and PaperMod features.

## Examples
- To add a new post for 2025: `hugo new posts/2025/my-new-post.md`
- To override the homepage, edit `layouts/_default/home.html`.
- To add custom CSS, edit `assets/css/extended/custom.css`.
