I want to create a personal website to showcase my projects and skills. I was thinking of giving the main page a terminal. You control the website by typing commands into the terminal, and it navigates to the different sections of the site. The website will be terminal-themed, with a modern look and feel.

Smooth animations and transitions will enhance the user experience. So that is good idea. 

I'm thinking of using next or Vite for building the site. (Though, Next.js might be a better fit for this project.) 

I want it to be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Here are some ideas for the terminal commands:
- `help`: Displays a list of available commands.
- `projects`: Lists my projects with links to their details.
- `skills`: Displays a list of my skills and technologies I work with.
- `about`: Provides information about me.
- `contact`: Displays my contact information.
- `clear`: Clears the terminal screen.
- `theme`: Changes the terminal theme (light/dark mode).
- `reboot`: Reloads the website to the main page.
- `shutdown`: Closes the terminal and displays a goodbye message.

When entering a command, the user should see a smooth transition to the corresponding section, with a loading animation if necessary. The terminal should also support autocomplete for commands, enhancing usability.

The terminal may be hidden and shown at the user's discretion, perhaps with a button or a keyboard shortcut.

I want to ensure that the terminal interface is intuitive and user-friendly. Here are some additional considerations:
- The terminal should have a blinking cursor to indicate where the user is typing.
- Input history should be supported, allowing users to navigate through previously entered commands using the up and down arrow keys.
- Error messages should be displayed in a user-friendly manner if an invalid command is entered.
- The terminal should support basic text formatting, such as bold and italic, to highlight important information.

Another idea is to include an Easter egg or two, like a fun animation or a hidden message that can be triggered by a specific command.

When the user enters the main page, they should see a welcome message and a brief introduction to the site. The terminal should feel like a central part of the website, guiding users through their journey.
The welocme message could be something like:

```
Welcome to my personal website! Type `help` to see what you can do here.
```
Wait, another thing to implement is that you have multiple welcome messages that are displayed in the terminal. The terminal swifts through them briefly. And to make it look like the terminal is typing itself, we can use a typing effect animation for the welcome messages, like that blinking cursor when it's typing.

Some kind of autocorrect for commands could also be useful, suggesting the closest command if the user mistypes something. This would improve usability and make the terminal feel more interactive.

When you want to go to a page, you type the command, like 'projects', and it will display a list of pages you can go to. You can then select a page using the arrow keys and press enter to navigate to it. This will create a more interactive experience, similar to navigating through a file system in a terminal.

The site should maintain its current features, like making posts in markdown, and it should be easy to add new projects or skills through a simple creation of a markdown file with its corresponding content. This will allow for easy updates and maintenance of the content.
Oh, yea its should be easy to update the content without having to modify the code directly. And I want it to be compatible with static site generation, so that it can be hosted easily on platforms like GitHub Pages.

To summarize, here are the key features and considerations for the personal website with a terminal interface:
- Terminal-themed design with a modern look and feel.
- Smooth animations and transitions for a better user experience.
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.
- Terminal commands for navigation and interaction.
- Autocomplete and input history support.
- Error handling for invalid commands.
- Typing effect animation for welcome messages.
- Easter eggs for fun interactions.
- Easy content updates through markdown files.
- Compatibility with static site generation for easy hosting.
- Intuitive and user-friendly terminal interface.
