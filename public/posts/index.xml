      <description>I would like to announce that I will be removing several inactive projects from my GitHub account. After reviewing my repositories, I&amp;rsquo;ve identified projects that are no longer being maintained or used.&#xA;Projects being removed:&#xA;Archcraft (GitHub)&#xA;A fork intended to replicate Arch Linux modifications without audio signals. (Arch Linux without the beeps)&#xA;Reason for removal: Lack of development progress. Vanilla-OS-image (GitHub)&#xA;A repo for a custom VanillaOS image that I was working on.</description>
