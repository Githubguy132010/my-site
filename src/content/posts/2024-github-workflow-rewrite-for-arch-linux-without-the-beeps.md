# The GitHub Workflow Rewrite

Today, I'd like to share how we've improved the GitHub Actions workflow for automatically building our Arch Linux ISO without system beeps. This workflow is a crucial component of our project, as it generates a fresh ISO with the latest updates daily.

## Key Improvements


1. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Addition of comprehensive error checking
   - Improved logging for debugging
   - Timeout limit of 120 minutes to prevent hanging builds
   - **Additional Details**: The error handling now includes specific checks for common issues such as network failures and package conflicts, ensuring that the build process is more resilient.

2. **Automated Release Notes**
   - Automatic generation of release notes
   - Including changelog since last release
   - Clear presentation of features and changes
   - **Additional Details**: The release notes are now formatted in Markdown, making them easy to read and integrate into our documentation.

3. **Security and Verification**
   - Automatic generation of SHA256 and SHA512 checksums
   - Build process verification
   - Checks for successful ISO creation
   - **Additional Details**: We have also implemented GPG signing for the ISOs, providing an additional layer of security and authenticity verification.

## Technical Details

The workflow runs in a Docker container based on Arch Linux, ensuring a clean and isolated build environment. We use `archiso` for building the ISO.



The build process is divided into clear steps:
1. Preparing the build environment
2. Caching Pacman packages
3. Building the ISO
4. Generating checksums
5. Creating a new release

If you want to see the complete workflow, I will post a snippet of it here:

```yaml
name: Build ISO

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Run the workflow every day at midnight
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - dev
    paths-ignore:
      - '**.md'
      - '.gitignore'

env:
  DOCKER_BUILDKIT: 1
  ISO_FILENAME: Arch.iso

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 120  # Set a timeout to prevent hung builds

**Additional Technical Insights**: The Docker container is configured to use the latest Arch Linux base image, ensuring that we always build with the most up-to-date packages. We have also optimized the Dockerfile to minimize the image size and build time.

## Future Improvements

Looking ahead, I plan to integrate more advanced features such as:
- **Parallel Builds**: To further reduce build times, I am exploring the possibility of running multiple build processes in parallel.
- **Automated Testing**: Implementing automated tests for the ISO to ensure that it functions correctly on a variety of hardware configurations.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Gathering feedback from users to continuously improve the build process and address any issues they encounter.

## Conclusion

This rewrite has resulted in a more reliable and efficient workflow. The daily builds are now faster and produce consistent results. The improved error handling and logging make it easier to identify and resolve any issues that may arise.

For those interested in the details: the complete workflow configuration can be found in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/thomasbrugman/Arch-Linux-without-the-beeps).
